            &nbsp;They are a lively group and full of themselves. You
            can see more photos of them on Cajun Ragdolls
            Facebook. These kittens will have been to vet three
            times prior to leaving my home. They will have been
            neutered, blood work, micorchip, vaccines, fecal.
            etc.. Additionally, they will come with CFA
            registration to confirm they are traditional Ragdolls
            with no out cross lines of other breeds. If the CFA
            shows were open, I would have kept all four boys
            and Grand Championed them prior to leaving as this
            is one very nice ltter. Therefore, these top show
            quality boys are leaving as wonderful loving pets.
            Both of their parent's are DNA negative for the eight
            genetic diseases and Blood Type A.
